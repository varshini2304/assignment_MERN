            A higher order Function(HOF) in Js is a function that either:
            Takes another function as an argument.
            Returns another function as its result.
            <p>
                Its main purpose is to enable functional programming techniques in JS.
                It provides Abstraction: we can focus on the operation being performed rather than the details of how it
                is implemented.
                Code Reusability: we can create generic functions that can be reused with different operations.
                Composition: we can combine simple functions to create more complex operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Practical usages of HOFs include maps, filters, and reducers for processing collections of data, event
                handling in web development, and implementing callbacks for asynchronous operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reducer is a function in JS that processes any array and reduce it to a single value by applying a
                specific operation on each element of the array. (Sum, Product, object, Min, Max etc.,,,)
